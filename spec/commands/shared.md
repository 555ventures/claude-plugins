# Spec Pipeline: Shared Invariants

Pipeline: `/spec:plan` (Fable) → `/spec:design` (optional, UI specs in Storybook hosts) →
`/spec:build` (Opus + `wf-spec-build` workflow) → `/spec:review` (independent gate).

## Host Grounding

The pipeline is process; the repo supplies grounding. Two host files, both created by
`/spec:init` (run it once per repo before first use):

- **`.claude/spec.config.json`** — machine-readable knobs: `gateCommand`, `testCommand`,
  `setupCommand`, `patternsScript`, optional `driftScript`, `storybook` (+ optional
  `storybookCommand`), `layerGroups`, `agentMap` (+ optional `routing` hints), `pipelineRules`.
- **The pipeline rules file** (path in `pipelineRules`, conventionally
  `.claude/rules/spec-pipeline.md`) — prose grounding by section: `Risk Tiers`, `Planning`,
  `Build`, `Worker Rules`, `Test Rules`, `Review Checks`.

Every command reads both at start. Repo differences live there — never as forks inside the
plugin's files. If either is missing, STOP and tell the user to run `/spec:init`.

## Pipeline Entry

The pipeline is opt-in heavy machinery, not the default path. The default is direct work: the
session explores, implements, and the host's `gateCommand` + its standards docs gate it. Enter
the pipeline only when the work needs at least one of:

1. **Delegation** — execution is large enough that Sonnet workers should do it while Fable only plans
2. **Durability** — scope spans sessions; the spec is the re-entrant state
3. **Gates** — T3 risk surfaces warrant refuters, independent review, and the state machine

Tiers set intensity inside the pipeline; these three criteria decide entry. A new product
surface (feature, domain, module) is a normal spec (usually a `depends_on` series) — there is
no separate pipeline for it.

## Risk Tiers

Applied mechanically at plan time; recorded as `risk:` in frontmatter. The concrete trigger
lists are host-specific — pipeline rules § Risk Tiers is authoritative. The shape:

- **T3** if ANY of the host's declared high-risk triggers (money paths, auth/permission logic,
  data migrations beyond pure-additive, contract surfaces consumed by 2+ areas, …).
- **T1** if ALL: single area; established pattern (covered by `docs/canonical/`, the host's
  standards docs, or an obvious codebase precedent); no cross-area contract change; no
  persisted-state/data migration. T1 = no spec, no pipeline — direct work gated by the host's
  `gateCommand`.
- **T2**: everything else. Enters the pipeline only when it needs delegation or durability
  (see Pipeline Entry) — otherwise direct work.

Mid-build evidence of a T3 trigger upgrades the tier immediately (note it in the spec; T3
checkpoints apply from that point).

Tier effects: refuters at plan (T2: 1, T3: 2) · reviewers at review (T2: 1, T3: 2) · refuters
per hard finding (always 2) · mandatory Fable checkpoints (T3 only; surfaces listed in
pipeline rules § Build).

## Decomposition

A spec must fit one `/spec:build` run: roughly ≤15 File Plan rows, one primary area (plus any
host-declared caps, e.g. at most one migration). Larger work splits into `##-` sibling specs
in the same date dir, sliced by **landing unit** — each spec independently leaves the system
green — never by layer. Order via `depends_on`; build and review slices in dependency order.

## State Machine

`draft → hardened → implementing → done`. Transitions owned by exactly one command each:
`/spec:plan` → `hardened`, `/spec:build` → `implementing`, `/spec:review` → `done`.
`/spec:design` never moves `status` — it sets the `designed:` date field only.
Enforced by the plugin's `spec-state-gate.sh` (UserPromptSubmit) — invoking `/spec:design`,
`/spec:build`, or `/spec:review` against a spec in the wrong state is blocked before the model
sees it.

## Design Stage (Storybook hosts only)

When the host config sets `storybook: true`, specs with a UI section default to
`storybook: true` frontmatter (set at plan time), which routes the spec through `/spec:design`
between plan and build: foundation files + stateless components + stories, the user actively
iterates in Storybook, and the spec is reconciled to the approved design before build starts.
Build then treats the approved components as done inputs — Storybook + the user's eyes gate UI
rendering; TDD gates logic. Skipping design on a `storybook: true` spec is the user's call,
not the model's. Hosts without Storybook never set the flag; the stage simply never runs.

## Model Placement

**Fable judges; Opus conducts; Sonnet works; Haiku looks up.**

| Model | Role |
|---|---|
| Fable | Spec authoring, design forks, build-time surprise consultation (the retainer), T3 checkpoints |
| Opus | Build/design orchestration, gate triage |
| Sonnet | Implementation, tests, stories, plan refuters, reviewers, finding refuters |
| Haiku | Lookups, searches, narrow reads |

- Every `Agent` call sets `model:` explicitly. Never inherit.
- **Reviews are never the planning model.** Cross-model independence beats capability — a
  same-model reviewer shares the blind spots that produced the bugs.
- **Fable retainer pattern:** spawn once on first surprise (`Agent {model: "fable"}` with the
  spec's Rationale + Assumptions), continue via `SendMessage` thereafter — it accumulates this
  run's context across consultations.

## Escalation Contract (build)

Mechanical triggers — consult the retainer, don't grind:

1. Worker returns `blocked` (stale assumption or unlocked design fork)
2. Deterministic gate failed twice on the same batch
3. A failure implicates a file outside the spec's File Plan
4. A needed change contradicts the approved design (`designed:` set) or a locked Decision
5. Any host-declared trigger (pipeline rules § Build — e.g. migration head conflicts)

Response path: retainer consult → if a genuine fork or scope change remains → `AskUserQuestion`
→ ruling written into the spec's **Decisions** table → workflow resumed (`resumeFromRunId` +
`resolutions[batchId]` cache salt). Completed work returns from the journal cache.

## Decisions

The spec's Decisions table is authoritative. Workers apply it verbatim, never invent entries,
never override. An unlocked fork is a `blocked` return, not a guess. A dismissed
`AskUserQuestion` STOPS the run — never invent the answer the user declined to give.

## Workflows Encode Shape, Not Judgment

The plugin's `wf-spec-build.js` and `wf-spec-review.js` own ordering, schemas, retry caps, and
kill rules — deterministic control flow. Judgment (what's blocked, what's waived, what
escalates, what a finding means) stays in the main loop. Never add JS branches that decide
design questions, and never prompt-engineer findings into existence (no "empty output = you
missed something" framings — an empty findings list is always a valid outcome).

## Worker Git Ban

Implementation workers never run git commands — no checkout/stash/restore/reset/clean/add/
commit. The orchestrator owns all git and checkpoint-commits after each green phase. A
repo-wide git op from one parallel worker destroys every sibling's uncommitted edits;
disjoint-file batching does not protect against it.

## Read-Only Surfaces

Hosts declare generated/managed surfaces (and their sanctioned change routes) in pipeline
rules § Worker Rules — e.g. generated API clients, codegen outputs, lockfiles, translation
catalogs. Nobody edits them by hand, worker or orchestrator; changes go through the declared
tool. The pattern sweep and the reviewer both treat hand-edits to them as hard findings.

## MCP Policy

Pre-emptive at **plan/design** time: run the registry/library lookups the host's pipeline
rules § Planning declares (UI registries, Context7 for third-party API shapes) before
specifying surfaces that rely on them. Results are **embedded into the spec** (UI / Contracts
sections) — `/spec:build` workers never query MCPs; they work from the spec and return
`blocked` if an embedded reference proves wrong against the installed version.

## Canonical Docs Loop

`/spec:plan` reads `docs/canonical/{area}.md` during discovery; `/spec:review` applies the
spec's Canonical Delta on `done` (creating the file if needed). Every landed spec makes more
future work T1-shaped — this loop is what shrinks pipeline spend over time. Don't skip the
delta to save a minute.
